## About this Project

Classic Tetris project implemented with HTML5 Canvas and pure JavaScript. It includes features such as random piece generation, collision detection, rotation, deletion of entire rows, a scoring system, pause, reset, and a game over screen. Ideal for learning key concepts in game logic, animation with requestAnimationFrame, and matrix manipulation.
